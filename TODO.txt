Embedded Systems for Education

- embedded systems start appearing early! in middle school
  - examples of the Arduino, micro:bit, CPX, etc.
  - we were involved in making micro:bit 
  - learned a lot of lessons, incorporated into new framework

- use higher-level scripting language (and transition to C++)
  - JavaScript (TypeScript) to C++
- school computers are locked down (hard to install toolchains, device drivers, apps)
  - in-browser compile chain
  - UF2
- microcontrollers will be embedded in projects (science experiments, etc) and powered by battery
  - CODAL design decisions
