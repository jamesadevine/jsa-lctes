% Current proposals for adding gradual typing to JavaScript, such as Closure, TypeScript and Dart, forgo soundness to deal with
% issues of scale, code reuse, and popular programming patterns. We show how to address these issues in practice while retaining
% soundness. We design and implement a new gradual type system, prototyped for expediency as a 'Safe' compilation mode for
% TypeScript. Our compiler achieves soundness by enforcing stricter static checks and embedding residual runtime checks in compiled
% code. It emits plain JavaScript that runs on stock virtual machines. Our main theorem is a simulation that ensures that the
% checks introduced by Safe TypeScript (1) catch any dynamic type error, and (2) do not alter the semantics of type-safe TypeScript
% code.
%
% Safe TypeScript is carefully designed to minimize the performance overhead of runtime checks. At its core, we rely on two new
% ideas: differential subtyping, a new form of coercive subtyping that computes the minimum amount of runtime type information that
% must be added to each object; and an erasure modality, which we use to safely and selectively erase type information. This allows
% us to scale our design to full-fledged TypeScript, including arrays, maps, classes, inheritance, overloading, and generic types.
%
% We validate the usability and performance of Safe TypeScript empirically by type-checking and compiling around 120,000 lines of
% existing TypeScript source code. Although runtime checks can be expensive, the end-to-end overhead is small for code bases that
% already have type annotations. For instance, we bootstrap the Safe TypeScript compiler (90,000 lines including the base
% TypeScript compiler): we measure a 15% runtime overhead for type safety, and also uncover programming errors as type safety
% violations. We conclude that, at least during development and testing, subjecting JavaScript/TypeScript programs to safe gradual
% typing adds significant value to source type annotations at a modest cost.

% Typescript extends JavaScript with optional type annotations that are, by design, unsound and, that the Typescript compiler
% discards as it emits code. This design point preserves programming idioms developers are familiar with, and allows them to leave
% their legacy code unchanged, while offering a measure of static error checking in parts of the program that have type
% annotations.
% We present an alternative design for TypeScript, one where it is possible to support
% the same degree of dynamism, but where types can be strengthened to provide hard guarantees.
% We report on an implementation, called StrongScript, that
% improves runtime performance of typed programs
% when run on a modified version of the V8 JavaScript engine.
